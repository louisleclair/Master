# Master at EPFL.

Herewith most of my work done during my first year of master at EPFL hoping I can help some of you in the future.

In MA1:

- TCP/IP (some documents might be missing but at the only the PDF is important, In hw03, I removed rockyou.txt dictionary and you might need it.)
- Cryptography (The homework might change so I don’t know if it will be very useful)
- ISP 

In MA2:

- ATOPET
- Database
- Advanced Cryptography

I don’t know if it will be useful in the future but if it is that the goal and if you have some problems or questions you can always ask me.
