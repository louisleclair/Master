# Master at EPFL.

Herewith most of my work done during my first year of master at EPFL hoping I can help some of you in the future.

In MA1:

- TCP/IP (some documents might be missing but at the only the PDF is important, In hw03, I removed __rockyou.txt__ dictionary and you might need it.)
- Cryptography (The homework might change so I donâ€™t know if it will be very useful)
- ISP 

In MA2:

- ATOPET
- Database
- Advanced Cryptography

I hope it will be useful :)
